Python as a DTrace consumer
===========================

This is a first shot into looking at getting something up and running like https://github.com/bcantrill/node-libdtrace for Python.

Note: This is far from ready - documentation on writing own DTrace consumers is very rare :-)

The codes in the examples folder should give an overview of how to use Python as a DTrace consumer.
